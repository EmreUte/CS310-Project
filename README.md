### Application Name: 
MyRide
### Main Purpose:
MyRide is a mobile application designed to improve the taxi-hailing experience by integrating personalized preference-based matching. Unlike traditional taxi services that assign the nearest available driver, MyRide ensures that both passengers and drivers are matched based on their mutual preferences, leading to higher satisfaction and a more comfortable ride experience.
### Target Audience:
- Passengers who want a more personalized and comfortable taxi experience.
- Drivers who prefer selecting rides that align with their own criteria.
- Taxi Companies looking to enhance customer satisfaction and retention.
### Key Features:
- **Preference-Based Matching:** Passengers and drivers set preferences (e.g., driver/passenger gender, vehicle type, smoking preference).
- **Smart Ride Assignment:** Uses a ranking system to match drivers and passengers for optimal satisfaction rather than just proximity.
- **Real-Time Booking & Tracking:** Users can request a ride and track their assigned taxi in real time.
- **Ride Ratings & Feedback:** Allows both parties to rate and provide feedback after each ride.
- **Secure Digital Payments:** Supports credit card, mobile wallets, and in-app payments for convenience.
### Platform:
The app will be developed using Flutter, making it compatible with both Android and iOS.
### Data Storage:
The application will securely store and manage:
- **User Profiles:** Passenger and driver details, including preferences. Ratings and reviews will also be visible on each profile. Users will also have their preferences saved. 
- **Ride History:** Trip details, timestamps, and locations.
Unique Selling Point:
MyRide stands out from other taxi services by offering a preference-driven ride-matching system. Instead of simply assigning the nearest driver, the app prioritizes user satisfaction, ensuring a more personalized and enjoyable ride experience.
### Challenges:
- **Efficient Matching Algorithm:** Developing an algorithm that balances user preferences while ensuring minimal wait times.
- **User Adoption:** Encouraging both drivers and passengers to switch from conventional ride-hailing services.
- **Scalability:** Managing a growing number of users while maintaining quick and efficient ride assignments.
- **Privacy & Security:** Ensuring user data is protected while complying with data protection regulations.
### End Goal
MyRide aims to revolutionize one-to-one transportation services by focusing on user satisfaction, making taxi rides more comfortable, efficient, and personalized.
